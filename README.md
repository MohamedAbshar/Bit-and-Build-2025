# Bit-and-Build-2025
Waste Segregation Using Image Detection

A BitnBuild Hackathon Project

📌 Overview

This project aims to tackle the global challenge of waste management by building an AI-powered waste segregation system. Using deep learning and computer vision, our model automatically classifies waste items (plastic, paper, glass, metal, cardboard, organic) to make recycling and disposal more efficient.

The solution is designed to be lightweight, accurate, and deployable in real-world scenarios such as smart bins, mobile apps, or cloud APIs.

🎯 Features

Automated waste classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (YOLOv12, etc.)

Real-time inference support (via TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile)

Deployable as:

📱 Mobile app for real-time scanning
